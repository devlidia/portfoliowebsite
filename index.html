            Hi, I'm Lidia Rocha! <img src="https://e7.pngegg.com/pngimages/980/783/png-clipart-purple-petaled-flower-illustration-purple-rose-flower-purple-roses-herbaceous-plant-flower-arranging.png" width="150px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am a full stack developer with 2 years of experience in both application and presentation layers.
            I have worked on applications and microservices deployed on IBM Cloud. 
            I have a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development.
            I have been able to build complex web applications for a variety of clients, from small startups to large corporations. 
            My experience in using programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Ruby on Rails, 
            combined with my knowledge of databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, 
            has allowed me to create dynamic and responsive applications that meet the needs of users.

          I had worked along with Lidia during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          She is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          She will be an asset for any organisation!

          Lidia developed software platforms, UI design, and web page design and development. 
          She played a significant role in developing and implementing overall web strategies.
          Her coding was excellent and her designs were unique and innovative, clients were always happy.

          During our time together, Lidia displayed great talents in technical applications, such as JavaScript, Python, 
          and several other data visualization tools. When we first met, I was immediately impressed with Lidia and her technical skills on day one.
